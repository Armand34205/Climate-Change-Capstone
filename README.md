# Climate-Change-Capstone

This Capstone project focuses on Exploratory Analysis of global land temperature data from the years 1913 - 2013. The intent of the project is to analyze earth surface temperature data, and create views that display the findings. The analysis aims to find the hottest and coldest countries in the world, and which have seen the greatest change in temperature over a 100 year span. It also highlights the changes in global temperature every year, and how the overall temperature has been rising drastically in the recent future. All views are displayed in an interactive Tableau dashboard, where filters can be applied to show data by year and country. The raw data comes from Berkeley Earth.
